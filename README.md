# 36q

simple app based on the [imgur's 36 questions](https://imgur.com/gallery/fIJ4S).
idea is that the hash of the URL fragment is used to
seed an RNG, so two users with the same url will get
the cards in the exact same order.

by sharing the url you are effectively shuffling the
deck and can both read the questions in the exact order.
